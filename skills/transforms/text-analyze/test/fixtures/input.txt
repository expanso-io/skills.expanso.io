Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook announced record quarterly revenue of $123.9 billion in Cupertino yesterday. Investors responded positively to the news, with shares rising 3% in after-hours trading.

The company attributed the strong performance to iPhone 15 sales and growing services revenue. "We're thrilled with our results," Cook said in a statement. "Our commitment to innovation continues to resonate with customers worldwide."

Analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their price target to $200, citing strong demand in China and India. However, some concerns remain about the global economic outlook and potential regulatory challenges in the European Union.
