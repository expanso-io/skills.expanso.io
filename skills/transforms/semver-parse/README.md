# semver-parse

Parse semantic version strings.

## Usage

`expanso-edge run` starts the node agent; it does not run a pipeline file. Check a pipeline locally with `expanso-edge validate`, as below. To execute one, deploy it with `expanso-cli job deploy FILE` from a saved Cloud profile with a connected node, then confirm with `expanso-cli job describe` and `expanso-cli execution list --job-id` (see [Confirm it actually ran](https://github.com/expanso-io/skills.expanso.io#confirm-it-actually-ran)). No Cloud run of this skill has been confirmed. `pipeline-cli.yaml` reads `stdin`, so it cannot receive input once scheduled on a remote node and has no supported Cloud run path as written (see [Providing input](https://github.com/expanso-io/skills.expanso.io#providing-input)).

```bash
expanso-edge validate pipeline-cli.yaml
```

## Output

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.3-beta",
  "major": 1,
  "minor": 2,
  "patch": 3,
  "prerelease": "beta",
  "valid": true
}
```
